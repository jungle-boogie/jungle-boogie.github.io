Hello, world. It's a lovely day.
<br>


<p>When I wake up in the morning, love</p>
<p>And the sunlight hurts my eyes</p>
<p>And something without warning, love</p>
<p>Bears heavy on my mind</p>
<br>

Then I look at you
And the world's alright with me
Just one look at you
And I know it's gonna be
A lovely day
A lovely day
<p></p>
When the day that lies ahead of me
Seems impossible to face
When someone else instead of me
Always seems to know the way

Then I look at you
And the world's alright with me
Just one look at you
And I know it's gonna be
A lovely day
A lovely day

When the day that lies ahead of me
Seems impossible to face
When someone else instead of me
Always seems to know the way

Then I look at you
And the world's alright with me
Just one look at you
And I know it's gonna be
A lovely day
A lovely day
