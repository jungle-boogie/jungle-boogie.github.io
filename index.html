Are you a WRETCH like me?
<br>
<br>

Amazing grace! how sweet the sound,<br>
  That saved a wretch; like me!<br>
I once was lost, but now am found,<br>
  Was blind, but now I see.<br>
<br>
’Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,<br>
  And grace my fears relieved;<br>
How precious did that grace appear<br>
  The hour I first believed!<br>
<br>
The Lord hath promised good to me,<br>
  His word my hope secures;<br>
He will my shield and portion be<br>
  As long as life endures.<br>
<br>
When we’ve been there ten thousand years,<br>
  Bright shining as the sun,<br>
We’ve no less days to sing God’s praise<br>
  Than when we first begun.<br>
