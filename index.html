Hello, world. It's a lovely day.
<br>
<br>

When I wake up in the morning, love<br>
And the sunlight hurts my eyes<br>
And something without warning, love<br>
Bears heavy on my mind<br>
<br>
Then I look at you<br>
And the world's alright with me<br>
Just one look at you<br>
And I know it's gonna be<br>
A lovely day<br>
... lovely day, lovely day, lovely day ...<br>
<br>
When the day that lies ahead of me<br>
Seems impossible to face<br>
When someone else instead of me<br>
Always seems to know the way<br>
<br>
Then I look at you<br>
And the world's alright with me<br>
Just one look at you<br>
And I know it's gonna be<br>
A lovely day.....<br>
<br>
